# Spatio-Temporal GNN-Based Crop Health Monitoring Website

This repository contains the source code for a web-based crop monitoring application that leverages satellite NDVI data and spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNN) to provide real-time crop health insights.

## About the Project

Farming requires constant monitoring of crop health to maximize yield and sustainability. This project uses satellite NDVI imagery combined with AI-driven models to assess vegetation health across large agricultural areas. The website visualizes crop status, detects anomalies early, and offers actionable insights for farmers and agronomists.

## Features

- Interactive map with live NDVI data visualization.
- Real-time crop health monitoring and anomaly detection.
- Historical trend analysis and forecasting.
- User-friendly alerts and notifications.
- Mobile-responsive design suitable for field use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- Internet connection to fetch satellite data and updates.
